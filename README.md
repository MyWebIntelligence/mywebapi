# MyWebIntelligence API scale project [In progess, 2026 June]

Component repository (backend at scale, optional).  
Start here for the main tool and installation: [https://github.com/MyWebIntelligence/mwi](https://github.com/MyWebIntelligence/mwi?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Roadmap (stabilization)
Target: Q2 2026
- [ ] End-to-end API aligned with mwi pipeline
- [ ] Versioned endpoints + minimal compatibility policy
- [ ] One-command demo + example dataset
- [ ] CI tests (smoke tests + lint)


This repository contains two main applications that are currently in a state of transition:

1.  **`MyWebIntelligenceAPI`**: A modern backend API built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Celery. It is designed for crawling and content analysis and is fully containerized. **This is the recommended component to run.**
2.  **`MyWebClient`**: A legacy web client (React + Node.js) that provides a UI for a **SQLite** database generated by a separate, older project (`MyWebIntelligencePython`). It does **not** connect to the `MyWebIntelligenceAPI`.

The long-term goal is to migrate `MyWebClient` to use the new `MyWebIntelligenceAPI`, but they currently operate independently.

## 1. MyWebIntelligenceAPI (Backend Service)

This is the main API for crawling, analysis, and data management. The simplest way to run it is with Docker.

### Prerequisites

*   Docker and Docker Compose

### Installation (Docker)

1.  **Clone the project**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd MyWebIntelligenceProject
    ```

2.  **Configure environment variables**
    The API requires its own environment file. Copy the example file inside the `MyWebIntelligenceAPI` directory.

    ```bash
    cp MyWebIntelligenceAPI/.env.example MyWebIntelligenceAPI/.env
    ```
    Edit `MyWebIntelligenceAPI/.env` if necessary. You must set the `SECRET_KEY` and other credentials.

3.  **Start the services**
    From the project root, run the following command. This will build the API image and start all necessary backend services.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    Database migrations are applied automatically when the API container starts, so no manual steps are needed.

### Accessing the API

*   **API Base URL**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
*   **Interactive documentation (Swagger)**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
*   **Alternative documentation (ReDoc)**: [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

### Included Services

The `docker-compose.yml` at the root orchestrates the following backend services:

*   `db`: PostgreSQL 15 database.
*   `redis`: Redis server for caching and Celery message brokering.
*   `mywebintelligenceapi`: The FastAPI application.
*   `celery_worker`: Celery worker for handling asynchronous tasks like crawling.

> **Note**: For local development without Docker, please refer to the instructions in `MyWebIntelligenceAPI/README.md`.

## 2. MyWebClient (Legacy Frontend)

This is the legacy web client. It runs independently from the `MyWebIntelligenceAPI` and connects to a separate SQLite database. It is considered a legacy component and is scheduled for future development to integrate with the new API.

### Installation

The installation for `MyWebClient` is documented in its own directory. It can be run either with Docker or directly from the source code.

**For detailed instructions, please refer to the dedicated README file:**
➡️ **[`MyWebClient/README.md`](./MyWebClient/README.md)**

The guide above explains how to:
*   Build and run the client using Docker.
*   Install and run it from the source code using `yarn`.
*   Correctly connect it to your legacy SQLite database file (`mwi.db`).
